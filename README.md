KataBankOCR
===========

This program covers all stories listed on the codingdojo.org KataBankOCR.

The problem description says this will be a program I am using, so the 
main function simply uses the exact directory where I have saved the text document.
For implementations where another user might need to use the program, I would
change this to a file selection window for both the scanned file and the output document.
